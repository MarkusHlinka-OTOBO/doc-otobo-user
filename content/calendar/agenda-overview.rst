Agenda Overview
===============

Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table-like overview. This overview is designed to have a detailed list of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in :doc:`calendar-overview` appointments can be created, edited or deleted.

.. note::

   There are no calendars added by default. Please contact your administrator to add one ore more calendars.
